# Simplaya
An open-source script to keep a video looping on a Raspberry Pi

Once the script works, the plan is to make an small image that can be easily loaded onto any Pi. Also, it'd be sweet to draft a printable (or cuttable) case.
Any and all help is appreciated!

# To Do
* Finish script
** Add command-line arguments
* Draft case
* Make image
* Reduce image
