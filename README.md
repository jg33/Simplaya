# Simplaya
An open-source script to keep a video looping on a Raspberry Pi

Once the script works, the plan is to make an small image that can be easily loaded onto any Pi. Also, it'd be sweet to draft a printable (or cuttable) case.
Any and all help is appreciated!

# To Do
* Improve script
** Add command-line arguments
** add fallback to folder on SD card
* Draft case
* Make image
* Reduce image - (switch to jessie lite?)
* Make sexy loading screen
* Add GPIO input for nice on/off button
